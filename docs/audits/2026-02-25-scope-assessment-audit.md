# Scope Assessment: Agent Team Control Surface

**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Status**: Assessment (no commitments)

---

## What We're Assessing

A system with two faces:

1. **CLI bridge** — MCP tools that let any CLI delegate work to a coding team
2. **Control surface** — Web app for monitoring, messaging, and managing agents

Both backed by the same orchestrator process that coordinates A2A agents.

## Complexity Tiers

### Tier 1: Low complexity (well-understood, library-backed)

- A2A server/client setup (SDK does the work)
- MCP tool registration (decorator-based)
- SQLite state persistence (aiosqlite, standard)
- Agent Card definitions (JSON structure)
- REST API for CRUD operations (FastAPI standard)
- Static file serving (FastAPI mount)
- Basic Svelte components (badges, buttons, tables)

### Tier 2: Moderate complexity (patterns exist, must adapt)

- WebSocket connection manager with multiplexing
- SSE event parsing and aggregation
- Permission request/response flow (ACP pattern adapted)
- Chat with contextId carry-forward (a2a-samples pattern)
- xterm.js terminal setup and WebSocket relay
- CodeMirror 6 read-only viewer
- Agent Card discovery and routing
- MCP tool surface for CLI bridge
- Git worktree lifecycle management

### Tier 3: High complexity (novel, no direct reference)

- **Process Manager on Windows** — asyncio subprocess management with
  CTRL_BREAK_EVENT shutdown, health probes, restart backoff, port allocation.
  No library does this for A2A agents. Closest reference: Claude Agent SDK's
  SubprocessCLITransport, supervisord state machine.

- **Event Aggregator** — Multiple concurrent SSE connections, per-agent state
  accumulation, reconnection with replay, fan-out to WebSocket. ACP's
  SessionAccumulator is the conceptual model but must be rebuilt for A2A events.

- **Scoped MCP Tool Server** — Per-agent filesystem isolation with path
  validation and command allowlists. Nothing in the ecosystem does this.
  Must be built from MCP server primitives.

- **Streaming artifact rendering** — Incremental code display as agents emit
  file chunks via TaskArtifactUpdateEvent. JS coder sample shows the pattern
  but integration with CodeMirror/xterm requires custom glue.

```

**Build order** (each layer depends on what's above it):

1. Agent Templates + Orchestrator Core (can be parallel)
2. Scoped MCP Tool Server (needs agent templates)
3. MCP Tool Surface + Web Backend (needs orchestrator core)
4. Web Frontend (needs web backend)
5. Workspace Manager (needs scoped MCP tool server)

## What's Hard and Why

### 1. Windows process management

Every sample runs on Linux/Mac. Windows subprocess lifecycle is different:

- `process.terminate()`is SIGKILL (no grace period)
- Need CTRL_BREAK_EVENT with CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP for graceful
- ProactorEventLoop (IOCP) is required and has limitations
-`create_subprocess_exec`only works from main thread
- No`os.killpg()`equivalent — need Job Objects for child cleanup

This is the single biggest platform risk.

### 2. SSE connection lifecycle

The orchestrator must maintain N concurrent SSE connections (one per agent
task). Each can drop, stall, or produce events faster than the WebSocket
can relay. Must handle:

- Connection pooling with httpx
- Reconnection via tasks/resubscribe (events during disconnect are lost)
- Backpressure (bounded EventQueue, 1024 items)
- Graceful shutdown (close all SSE when agent dies)

### 3. Scoped filesystem access

No MCP tool server implementation enforces path boundaries. We must build
path validation that prevents agents from escaping their worktree root.
This includes handling symlinks,`..`traversal, Windows path normalization
(forward/backward slashes, drive letters, UNC paths).

### 4. Consistent state across disconnections

When a browser tab closes and reopens, the UI must show current state.
Requires event sourcing to SQLite + snapshot reconstruction. When WebSocket
reconnects, server must determine what the client missed and replay or
send a full snapshot. Hybrid approach: rolling buffer (last N events per
agent) + full snapshot fallback.

---

## What's Surprisingly Easy

### 1. A2A agent creation

The SDK does nearly everything. Implement`AgentExecutor.execute()`, define
an `AgentCard`, wire up `DefaultRequestHandler`, run with uvicorn. ~50 lines
for a minimal agent.

### 2. MCP tool registration

```python
@mcp.tool()
def team_status(session_id: str) -> dict:
    return orchestrator.get_status(session_id)
```

That's it. Schema generated from type hints. Any MCP-supporting CLI can
call it.

### 3. ACP web feasibility

ACP's transport layer is abstracted. `Connection` takes
`asyncio.StreamReader/Writer` — not hardwired to stdio. WebSocket adapter
is ~100 lines. The entire SessionAccumulator/PermissionBroker/ToolCallTracker
stack works unchanged over WebSocket.

### 4. xterm.js integration

xterm-svelte wraps xterm.js for Svelte. Backend sends stdout lines over
WebSocket, frontend writes to terminal. Established pattern used by
code-server, Theia, JupyterLab.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows subprocess issues | High | High | Early spike: build ProcessManager first, test on Windows |
| MCP tasks never stabilize | Medium | Medium | Already mitigated: using stable tools, not experimental |
| CLI tools don't support our MCP tools well | Medium | Low | MCP tools are standard; any LLM can call them |
| xterm.js memory with many agents | Medium | Low | Limit scrollback (5K lines), persist to SQLite |
| Agent LLM costs spiral | High | Medium | Budget per task, token tracking, hard limits |
| A2A SDK breaking changes | Medium | Low | Pin version, abstract behind thin layer |
| SvelteKit learning curve | Low | Medium | Svelte 5 is simpler than React; Open WebUI proves pattern |
| SQLite contention under load | Low | Low | WAL mode, single-user tool, unlikely bottleneck |

## Sizing Estimate (Rough Order of Magnitude)

Not time estimates. Component count and relative weight.

| Component | Files | Relative Weight | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Process Manager | 3-5 | Heavy | Windows-specific, state machine, health checks |
| Event Aggregator | 3-4 | Heavy | SSE management, state accumulation, replay |
| Agent Registry | 1-2 | Light | Dict + persistence |
| Permission Manager | 2-3 | Medium | Rules, routing, persistence |
| MCP Tool Surface | 1-2 | Light | 5 tool functions |
| Web Backend (FastAPI) | 3-5 | Medium | WebSocket, REST, static |
| Coding Agent Template | 2-3 | Medium | Executor, LLM glue, card |
| Scoped MCP Tool Server | 2-3 | Medium | fs/git/cmd with path validation |
| Workspace Manager | 1-2 | Light | Git worktree operations |
| Frontend (SvelteKit) | 10-15 | Heavy | Multiple interactive components |
| **Total** | **~30-45 files** | | |

The heaviest work is in three places: **Process Manager**, **Event
Aggregator**, and **Frontend components**. Everything else composes
from existing libraries and SDKs.
